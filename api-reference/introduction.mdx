description: Complete reference for the Voice Agents REST API.
---

The Voice Agents API lets you onboard workspaces, create and manage assistants, initiate outbound calls, and handle real-time webhook events programmatically.

## Base URL

All API requests target the production server:

```
https://api.voice-agents.miraiminds.co
```

A staging environment is also available for testing:

```
https://api.stage.voice-agent.miraiminds.co
```

## Authentication

Every request must include two API key headers:

| Header          | Description                            |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| `x-public-key`  | Your public API key for identification |
| `x-private-key` | Your private API key for authorization |

Most endpoints also require a `workspace` header to scope requests to a specific workspace.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.voice-agents.miraiminds.co/v2/call/initiate \
  -H "x-public-key: pk_your_public_key" \
  -H "x-private-key: sk_your_private_key" \
  -H "workspace: your_workspace_id" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ ... }'
```

<Note>
  Contact [sneh@miraiminds.co](mailto:sneh@miraiminds.co) to obtain your API keys and workspace ID.

## Common error codes

| Code  | Meaning                                             |
| :---- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| `200` | Success                                             |
| `201` | Resource created                                    |
| `400` | Bad request — check your request body or parameters |
| `401` | Unauthorized — missing or invalid API keys          |
| `403` | Forbidden — insufficient permissions                |
| `404` | Not found — resource does not exist                 |
| `429` | Rate limit exceeded — wait before retrying          |
| `500` | Internal server error                               |

## Rate limits

The API enforces rate limits to ensure stability. If you receive a `429` response, wait before retrying. Assistant updates have a cooldown period to prevent overlapping update operations.

<Warning>
  Keep your `x-private-key` secure. Never expose it in client-side code or public repositories.
</Warning>
